## Hi, I'm Marius Kimmina.

I am a software engineer with a deep interest in backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and the human side of technology. I believe that building great software is as much about understanding people as it is about understanding code.

### What I do

Currently, I focus on:
- **Backend Architecture:** Designing scalable and resilient systems using Go, Rust, and Node.js.
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Automating deployments and managing infrastructure as code with Terraform and Nix.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Writing about my experiences and speaking at community events.

### My Philosophy

I strive for simplicity and clarity in everything I build. I'm a strong advocate for open source and believe in the power of community-driven development.

When I'm not at my desk, you might find me exploring local cafes, reading a good book, or contributing to various open-source projects.
