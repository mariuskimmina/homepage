# About Me

</div>

For most of my early life computers where just there to play video games. I got into World of Warcraft early in my teenage years but since 
I couldn't afford the 15$ per month to play on the official servers I got into private ones - editing the `realmlist.wtf` file was my first exposure to 
how online games worked under the hood but I didn't go much deeper than that during those days.

After school I took an apprenticeship as IT Systems Technican mostly because, well, I had to do something. Towards the end of it I had grown very bored and wanted to do
something more interesting, I somehow, I honestly don't remember how, found out about IT-Security, hacking and penetration testing and of course that sounded super intriguing to me 
back in those days - like you are telling me I could get paid to hack people?

I realized I had to learn a lot and decided to start a computer science degree. Security remained my main interest for a while longer, I played CTFs all night, hacking intentionally 
vulnerable systems and went to the [Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/en/congress/) for the first time in 2019. I also grew more interested in another area of Software 
Development around this time, deployments, servers, infrastructure and CI/CD. I became really fascinated by all the things it takes to run large scale production systems
and how to get code from the developers computer into the world - which is what I am still working on today.
