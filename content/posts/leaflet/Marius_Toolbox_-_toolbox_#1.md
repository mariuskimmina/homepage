Welcome dear Reader,

I am Marius and I've been a bit obsessed with developer tooling and workflows for a while now. There is a certain feeling that you get from things that work really well and exactly the way you want them to.



I've been working as a Software Engineer & DevOps Engineer (I know I hate that title too) for ~7 years now. I've figured out pretty early on in my career that what interests me the most are all the things around the code, such as production deployments, observability, infrastructure, scaling, databases and development workflows. Especially since these things became more & more codified through Infrastructure as Code and the like.



In this newsletter I'll document my journey of adopting new tools, improving workflows as well as sharing what didn't work for me. How often I am going to publish, how long these articles will be and what I am going to focus on the most, that we'll all figure out together. I don't have clear plan laid out just yet.



Here are some of the tools I am currently using to give you an idea of what might be coming next:



- Neovim
- Ghostty
- Tmux
- Lazygit
- Terraform / Opentofu
- Fish (shell)
- Docker / Podman
- kind (kubernetes in docker)
- k9s
- Obsidian (notes)
- Go



This is not an exhaustive list but I hope it gives you an Idea of the kind of things this newsletter will be all about. You can probably already tell that I am a terminal geek and that's where I plan on staying throughout all of this.



You can also find my current configurations in my [.dotfiles repo](https://github.com/mariuskimmina/.dotfiles) - currently only on Github I am considering moving it over to Tangled and keeping Github as a readonly mirror.



Some tools I am particularly excited about exploring at the moment



- jj (jujutsu vcs)
- nix / NixOS



I might also sneak in some less technical articles around how I manage work and personal projects with Obsidian and note taking - if there is interests in this kind of thing too.



I'd be beyond happy to have people reach out with suggestions, you can always message me on BlueSky.
